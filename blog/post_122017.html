Few days are remaining from 2017 and I am racing with time to finish revision of papers due. I am also trying to run as many granular physics simulations (for studying friction) as I need and can on <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/researchcomputing/index.xml">Princeton Research Computing</a> Tiger cluster at this relatively quiet time with the cluster (most nodes are empty, no queue time). I also need to finish draft of a first paper on pattern (and cyclones!) formation on perturbed granular beds!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
In the meantime and while simulations are running, I will be visiting the <a href="http://whitney.org">Whitney Museum of American Art</a> tomorrow with friends and colleagues in NYC! It is going to be a very cold day, but I cannot wait for that!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I just spent five hours of my Christmas Monday on installing <b>gfortran</b> on MacOS High Sierra! I was getting the following error while running some simple Fortran codes for earthquake source simulations. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>FATAL:/opt/local/bin/../libexec/as/x86-64/as: I don't understand 'm' flag! 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
</tt>I thought it is due to some configuration problems of the latest version of gfortran -that I installed from the <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortranBinariesMacOS">GNU project</a>- with recent MacOS. I was right, it turned out that the latest releases (ver&#62;7) of gfortran (maybe only for this particular use) is not compatible with OS High Sierra anymore. A solution that I found after hours of struggle, was to install an older version of fortran <b>gcc6.4</b> that with itself has <b>gfortran6</b>. This could be installed via <b>MacPorts</b>:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<tt>sudo port install gcc6

<div class="p"><!----></div>
</tt>and will have the following name in the binaries folder: "gfortran-mp-6".
