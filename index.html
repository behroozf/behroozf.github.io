I am <b>Behrooz Ferdowsi</b>, currently a Hess Fellow and Postdoctoral Research Associate at the <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/geosciences/">Department of Geosciences, Princeton University</a>.  I am at the moment mostly collaborating with <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/geosciences/people/rubin/">Prof. Allan M. Rubin</a> and <a href="http://coewww.rutgers.edu/~shinbrot/Web2009/index.html">Prof. Troy Shinbrot</a> (Rutgers University) on physics of earthquake fault friction (also known as rate- and state-dependent friction laws), granular friction and granular flows, and planetary surface and subsurface processes. Before coming to Princeton, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Pennsylvania, <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/pennsed/">Sediment Dynamics Laboratory (PennSeD)</a> and a Synthesis Postdoctoral Fellow of the <a href="http://www.nced.umn.edu">National Center for Earth-Surface Dynamics (NCED)</a>. At PennSeD, I worked with <a href="https://www.sas.upenn.edu/earth/people/douglas-j-jerolmack">Prof. Douglas J. Jerolmack</a> (UPenn, Earth and Environmental Science) on bimodal sediment transport, subsurface to surface evolution of riverbeds and also granular controls of hillslope creep and landscape evolution. I also worked with my NCED-synthesis postdoctoral team (a team of highly motivated early career Earth scientists) to develop what we call an Earthcasting framework that we hope will shape the future of applied and fundamental research in Earth surface science. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I received my PhD (Dr. sc.) from <a href="https://www.ethz.ch/en.html">ETH Zurich</a> (Switzerland) under supervision of <a href="http://www.carmeliet.ethz.ch">Prof. Jan Carmeliet</a> and <a href="http://www.calcolodistr.altervista.org/en/index_en.html">Dr. Michele Griffa</a> and in collaboration with <a href="http://www.lanl.gov/orgs/ees/ees11/geophysics/staff/johnson/johnson.shtml">Dr. Paul Johnson</a> (Los Alamos National Laboratory) and <a href="http://www.geosc.psu.edu/academic-faculty/marone-chris">Prof. Chris Marone</a> (Pennsylvania State University).

<h2><div class="large">Research interests</div></h2>

I have a broad research interest in several (and expanding) areas of geosciences, including earthquake physics, hillslope and landscape evolution, fluvial and aeolian transport, stratigraphy and sedimentology. The unifying concept of my research interests however lies in soft condensed matter physics and the statistical physics of particles and fields. I search for universal laws that can describe evolution of different sections (and cross-sections) of Earth and other planets across the scales of time (sub-second to million years) and length (asperities and grains to geo/log/phy/ical scales). For my works, I often use a combination of laboratory-scale experiments, numerical (Discrete Element Method and Molecular Dynamics) simulations, and analytical (sometimes continuum) modeling, with continuous inspiration and insight from direct (by myself) and indirect (previously published, collected, documented) field observations.

<h3><i><div class="normalsize">a) Evolution of riverbed surface in gravel-bed rivers (2015-2017)</div></i></h3>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
In collaboration with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=s0qqJ7IAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate">Dr. Carlos P. Ortiz</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/houssaismorgane/">Dr. Morgane Houssais</a> and under direction of <a href="https://www.sas.upenn.edu/earth/people/douglas-j-jerolmack">Prof. Doug Jerolmack</a>, I focused on armoring phenomenon in idealized bimodal laboratory river. River beds often exhibit "armoring", in which formation of a coarse surface layer shields the finer underlying grains from erosion. Models assume that armor develops due to sorting of surficial grains by the fluid flow. In this work, we show how motion of grains deep beneath the surface delivers larger grains to the surface. Using experiments in a laboratory river, and discrete and continuum models, we further demonstrate that river-bed armoring is driven by vertical granular segregation and that the fluid has little effect. Results also reveal different segregation mechanisms for deep versus shallow grains, which has broader implications for all manner of granular flows.

Note the first rapid stage of armoring, which is dependent on Shields number and is associated with bed-load transport, and the second slower stage that exhibits a nearly constant rate for all Shields numbers and is the result of creep.

<h3><i><div class="normalsize">b) Hillslope evolution and landscape dynamics over geological timescales (2016-present)</div></i></h3>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Soil creeps imperceptibly downhill, but also fails catastrophically to create landslides. Despite the importance of these processes as hazards and in sculpting landscapes, there is no agreed upon model that captures the full range of behavior. In this work, we examine the granular origins of hillslope soil transport by Discrete Element Method simulations, and re-analysis of measurements in natural landscapes. We find creep for slopes below a critical gradient, where average particle velocity (sediment flux) increases exponentially with friction coefficient (gradient). At critical there is a continuous transition to a dense-granular flow rheology, consistent with previous laboratory experiments. Slow earthflows and landslides thus exhibit glassy dynamics characteristic of a wide range of disordered materials; they are described by a two-phase flux equation that emerges from grain-scale friction alone. This glassy model reproduces topographic profiles of natural hillslopes, showing its promise for predicting hillslope evolution over geologic timescales.

<h3><i><div class="normalsize">c) Physics of rate- and state-dependent friction laws for fault gouge (2015-present)</div></i></h3>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Numerical simulations of earthquake nucleation rely on constitutive rate and state evolution laws to model earthquake initiation and propagation processes. The response of different state evolution laws to large velocity increases is an important feature of these constitutive relations that can significantly change the style of earthquake nucleation in numerical models. However, currently there is not a rigorous understanding of the physical origins of the response of bare rock or gouge-filled fault zones to large velocity increases. This in turn hinders our ability to design physics-based friction laws that can appropriately describe those responses. We here argue that most fault zones form a granular gouge after an initial shearing phase and that it is the behavior of the gouge layer that controls the fault friction. We perform numerical experiments of a confined sheared granular gouge under a range of confining stresses and driving velocities relevant to fault zones and apply 1-3 order of magnitude velocity steps to explore dynamical behavior of the system from grain- to macro-scales. We compare our numerical observations with experimental data from biaxial double-direct-shear fault gouge experiments under equivalent loading and driving conditions. Our intention is to first investigate the degree to which these numerical experiments, with Hertzian normal and Coulomb friction laws at the grain-grain contact scale and without any time-dependent plasticity, can reproduce experimental fault gouge behavior. We next compare the behavior observed in numerical experiments with predictions of the Dieterich (Aging) and Ruina (Slip) friction laws. Finally, the numerical observations at the grain and meso-scales will be used for designing a rate and state evolution law that takes into account recent advances in rheology of granular systems, including local and non-local effects [<a href="#DeGiuli15082017" id="CITEDeGiuli15082017" class="tth_citation">9</a>,<a href="#zhang2017microscopic" id="CITEzhang2017microscopic" class="tth_citation">10</a>,<a href="#henann2013predictive" id="CITEhenann2013predictive" class="tth_citation">11</a>], for a wide range of shear rates and slow and fast deformation regimes of the fault gouge.
