<h2><div class="normalsize">Intro</div></h2>

Welcome to my new (and currently under major reconstruction) webpage! I am <b>Behrooz Ferdowsi</b>, currently a Hess Fellow and Postdoctoral Research Associate at the Department of Geosciences, Princeton University.  I am at the moment mostly collaborating with Prof. Allan M. Rubin and Prof. Troy Shinbrot (Rutgers University) on physics of earthquake fault friction (also known as rate- and state-dependent friction laws) and planetary surface and subsurface processes. Before coming to Princeton, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Pennsylvania, Sediment Dynamics Laboratory (PennSeD) and a Synthesis Postdoctoral Fellow of the National Center for Earth-Surface Dynamics (NCED). At PennSeD, I worked with Prof. Douglas J. Jerolmack (UPenn, Earth and Environmental Science) on bimodal sediment transport, subsurface to surface evolution of riverbeds and also granular controls of hillslope creep and landscape evolution. I also worked with my NCED-synthesis postdoctoral team (a team of highly motivated early career Earth scientists) to develop what we call an Earthcasting framework that we hope will shape the future of applied and fundamental research in Earth surface science. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I received my PhD (Dr. sc.) from ETH Zurich (Switzerland) under supervision of Prof. Jan Carmeliet and Dr. Michele Griffa and in collaboration with Dr. Paul Johnson (Los Alamos National Laboratory) and Prof. Chris Marone (Pennsylvania State University). For my PhD, I studied Dynamic Earthquake Triggering phenomenon, that is triggering of earthquakes by other (seismic) sources.

<h2><div class="normalsize">Research interests</div></h2>

I have a rather broad research interest in several (and expanding) areas of geosciences, including earthquake physics, hillslope and landscape evolution, fluvial and aeolian transport, and even stratigraphy. The unifying concept of my research interests however lies in soft condensed matter physics and the statistical physics of particles and fields. I search for universal laws that can describe evolution of different sections (and cross-sections) of Earth and other planets across the scales of time (sub-second to million years) and length (from asperities and grains to geo/log/phy/ical scales).
