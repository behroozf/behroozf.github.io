<div class="p"><!----></div>
Welcome to my webpage! I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/geosciences/">Department of Geosciences, Princeton University</a>. Previously, I was a Harry H. Hess Postdoctoral Fellow (2017-2019) at Princeton Geosciences. I am primarily working with <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/geosciences/people/rubin/">Prof. Allan M. Rubin</a> on constitutive laws for rock friction, also known as rate- and state-dependent friction laws. My work is currently supported by funds from the United States National Science Foundation, and the United States Geological Survey.
<p>


Before coming to Princeton in June 2017, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Pennsylvania, <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/pennsed/">Sediment Dynamics Laboratory (PennSeD)</a> and a Synthesis Postdoctoral Fellow of the <a href="http://www.nced.umn.edu">National Center for Earth-Surface Dynamics (NCED)</a> (February 2015 to May 2017). At PennSeD, I worked with <a href="https://www.sas.upenn.edu/earth/people/douglas-j-jerolmack">Prof. Douglas J. Jerolmack</a> (UPenn, Earth and Environmental Science) on bimodal sediment transport, subsurface to surface evolution of riverbeds and also granular controls of hillslope creep and geophysical landscape evolution. I received my PhD (Dr. sc.) in September 2014, from <a href="https://www.ethz.ch/en.html">ETH Zurich</a> (Switzerland), Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering. For my PhD research, I studied the influence of vibrations on the frictional behavior of sheared granular layers.<p>

As a person whose research and academic endeavors have been affected by exclusivity (because of my national origin, I experienced a one-year-long postdoc visa delay when moving for my first postdoc to the US. I have been then subject to the US Travel Ban from January 2017, because of my national origin, while I was studying and doing research for my first postdoctoral appointment in the US. This situation continues until nowadays, which means that I cannot travel for visits, meetings and conferences anywhere outside the United States of America), I am strongly committed to inclusivity, increasing of diversity, and broadening the participation of and advancement of under-represented groups and minorities in the academic and research environments.<p> 

Please send me an email at the address below, if you need an updated copy of my academic resume.<p><div style="height:12px;font-size:1px;">&nbsp;</div>

<font size="4", font color="green"><b>Information for ReMatch and prospective ReMatch+ Summer Programs participants</b></font><div style="height:3px;font-size:1px;">&nbsp;</div>
I am participating as a mentor for first and second-year undergraduate students, in the <a href="https://undergraduateresearch.princeton.edu/programs/rematch" target="_blank">ReMatch</a> program of the Princeton University, Office of Undergraduate Research. I look forward to meeting with students at ReMatch Meet and Greet session on October 14th and ReMatch Meals for Mentoring sessions on November 13th and 14th. Students can also reach out to me for any questions at my email address below. I would like to take in a student, with my advisor as the official department advisor, for research opportunities in summer 2020. I am also available and will be glad to help students with developing their research proposals for the <a href="https://undergraduateresearch.princeton.edu/programs/summer-programs/rematchplus" target="_blank">ReMatch+ Summer Program</a>, with target dates in January and February 2020. My current topics of interest include but are not limited to, better understanding the mechanisms and processes that shape the surface and near-surface of the Earth and other planets (and asteroids) on a wide range of time (and space) scales, i.e., from the scale of immediate interest for humans and life (decades to some centuries), to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geologic_time_scale" target="_blank">geologic</a> time scale (millions of years). Please note that my research interests are broad and I am flexible to help and become a mentor in a variety of topics that students find most interesting -- as long as we share some common scientific interests.

<h2><font size="4", font color="black">Research interests</font>
</div></h2>


My research activities are at the interface of <i>Mechanics of Materials</i>, <i>Geophysics</i>, <i>Geology</i>, and <i>Soft and Granular Matter Physics</i>. Until nowadays, I have worked on problems in rock friction and fault mechanics, geophysical landscape evolution, and soil and sediment transport in rivers and hillslopes, among others. I am generally interested in using a broad set of tools, for connecting observations in the area of <i>Solid Earth Geosciences, broadly, i.e. Earth's surface and subsurface processes</i>, to their physical and chemical origins as quantitatively as possible, across the scales. The immediate applications are in prediction and modeling of geohazards (earthquakes, earthflows, and landslides, as some examples), flow and failure of geomaterials at different environmental conditions, and better understanding of the processes that shape the surface and subsurface of the Earth (and other planets). At some stage, this broad and important goal would also require new developments in applied mathematics and applied mechanics, as well as advances in observational methods, through laboratory and field-based experiments. That is the direction I am moving toward. Some of my more specific interests include but are not limited to:

<ul>
  <li>Development of constitutive laws and Equations of State for Earth and planetary materials at the Earth's surface, near surface, and subsurface;</li><br> 
  <li>Applications of soft condensed matter phyiscs in geosciences, from lab and theory to the (geological) field: sediment transport, frictional behavior and rheology of Earth materials;</li><br> 
  <li>Experimentally-based analytical/computational and multiscale modeling for geoscientific problems; asymptotic analysis;</li><br> 
  <li>Continuum (finite elemenet method), discontinuum (discrete element method, molecular dynamics), and coupled modeling approaches;</li><br> 
  <li>Physics of granular and disordered media.</li><br>
</ul>

<h2><font size="4", font color="black">Ongoing collaborations</font>
</div></h2>

<ul>

   <li> My research at Princeton on the granular physics contribution to rate- and state-dependent friction of rock and glacial till is a continuation of a two-year-long research and collaboration that started in early summer 2015 with Professors <a href="https://www.sas.upenn.edu/earth/people/david-l-goldsby">David L. Goldsby</a> and <a href="https://www.sas.upenn.edu/earth/people/douglas-j-jerolmack">Douglas J. Jerolmack</a> at the University of Pennsylvania, also in collaboration with <a href="https://www.geosc.psu.edu/academic-faculty/marone-chris">Professor Chris J. Marone</a> at the Pennsylvania State University (funded by a grant from the Southern California Earthquake Center (SCEC award #16059 to Prof. Goldsby, resulting from a SCEC proposal submitted in October 2015), and through support from Prof. Jerolmack). This collaboration resulted in two posters at SCEC 2015 and 2016 Annual Meetings on granular physics of rate-state friction, and a review paper on granular origins of rate-state friction (drafted in October 2015). The collaboration with Prof. Marone on this topic continues through a collaborative NSF proposal between Prof. Marone and my current advisor Prof. Rubin at Princeton University. The very first initiation of my research on granular physics of rate-state friction started with some slide-hold-slide (this is an standard rate-state protocol) experiments I performed with the granular model I developed during my PhD research. I have continued research on this topic as soon as I started my first postdoc at UPenn PennSeD and within new collaborations I developed at UPenn.</li><br>

  <li>With <a href="https://www.sas.upenn.edu/earth/people/douglas-j-jerolmack">Prof. Douglas J. Jerolmack</a> (University of Pennsylvania), I continue to work on granular physics of creep as related to soil and sediment transport in natural environments. The first results of this project were reported in our Nature Communications (2017) and PNAS (2018) papers. The results were also reported in numerous oral and poster presentations at international meetings and workshops, including at the American Geophysical Union Meetings (2015, 2016, 2017, 2018), Engineering Mechanics Institute Conference 2019, Gordon Research Conference Granular Physics 2016, Northeastern Granular Materials Workshops 2015 and 2016, and several departmental seminars at US-based universities and institutions by B. Ferdowsi, Prof. Jerolmack, and collaborators.</li><br>

  <li>With <a href="http://scrippsscholars.ucsd.edu/jwillenbring">Prof. Jane Willenbring</a> (Scripps Institution of Oceanography, and the University of California San Diego) and Emma Harrison (PhD student in Jane's group), I am working on the implications and controls of slow granular deformations for the rate of soil transport and mixing in the field. The first results of this work was presented at the American Geophysical Union Meeting (2018). </li><br>

  <li>With <a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/enrique-del-castillo">Enrique Miguel del Castillo</a> '19 (Princeton, now PhD student at Stanford University), I am continuing to work on the grain-scale physics of critical-taper theory and mountain-building processes.</li><br> 

  <li>With <a href="http://coewww.rutgers.edu/~shinbrot/Web2009/index.html">Prof. Troy Shinbrot</a> (Rutgers University), I have been working on pattern formation in deep perturbed/vibrated granular layers, through experiments and simulations. We also worked on charge transfer and charging phenomenon in vibrated granular beds.</li><br>
