<div class="p"><!----></div>
Welcome to my webpage! I am <b>Behrooz Ferdowsi</b>, currently a Hess Fellow and Postdoctoral Research Associate at the <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/geosciences/">Department of Geosciences, Princeton University</a>.  I am primarily working with <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/geosciences/people/rubin/">Prof. Allan M. Rubin</a> on constitutive laws for rock friction, also known as rate- and state-dependent friction laws.<p>

<div class="p"><!----></div>

Before coming to Princeton, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Pennsylvania, <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/pennsed/">Sediment Dynamics Laboratory (PennSeD)</a> and a Synthesis Postdoctoral Fellow of the <a href="http://www.nced.umn.edu">National Center for Earth-Surface Dynamics (NCED)</a>. At PennSeD, I worked with <a href="https://www.sas.upenn.edu/earth/people/douglas-j-jerolmack">Prof. Douglas J. Jerolmack</a> (UPenn, Earth and Environmental Science) on bimodal sediment transport, subsurface to surface evolution of riverbeds and also granular controls of hillslope creep and geophysical landscape evolution. I received my PhD (Dr. sc.) from <a href="https://www.ethz.ch/en.html">ETH Zurich</a> (Switzerland), Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering. For my PhD research, I studied the influence of vibrations on the frictional behavior of sheared granular layers.

<h2><div class="large"><font size="5", font color="blue">Research interests</font>
</div></h2>


Until nowadays, I have worked on problems in rock friction and fault mechanics, geophysical landscape evolution, and soil and sediment transport, among others. I am generally interested in connecting observations in the area of <i>Solid Earth Geosciences, broadly, i.e. Earth's surface and subsurface</i>, to their physical and chemical causes and origins as quantitatively as possible, across the scales. At some stage, this broad and important goal would require new developments in applied mathematics and applied mechanics, an improved understanding of the physical chemistry of Earth materials and processes, as well as advances in observational methods, through laboratory and field-based experiments. That is the direction I am moving toward. Some of my more specific interests include but are not limited to:

<ul>
  <li>Development of constitutive laws and Equations of State for Earth and planetary materials at the Earth's surface, near surface, and subsurface;</li>
  <li>Experimental physics with a focus on soft condensed matter phyiscs for geosciences (sediment transport, frictional behavior and rheology of Earth materials);</li>
  <li>Experimentally-based analytical/computational and multiscale modeling for geoscientific problems;</li>
  <li>Continuum (finite elemenet method), discontinuum (discrete element method, molecular dynamics), and coupled modeling approaches;</li>
  <li>Physics of granular and disordered media.</li>
</ul>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br> 

<h2><div class="large"><font size="5", font color="blue">Ongoing collaborations</font>
</div></h2>

<ul>

   <li> My research at Princeton on the granular physics contributions to rock friction emerged out of a two-year-long discussions and collaborations with Professors <a href="https://www.sas.upenn.edu/earth/people/david-l-goldsby">David L. Goldsby</a> and <a href="https://www.sas.upenn.edu/earth/people/douglas-j-jerolmack">Douglas J. Jerolmack</a> at the University of Pennsylvania, also in collaboration with <a href="https://www.geosc.psu.edu/academic-faculty/marone-chris">Professor Chris J. Marone</a> at the Pennsylvania State University (funded by a grant from the Southern California Earthquake Center, and through support from Prof. Jerolmack). The collaboration with Prof. Marone on this topic continues through a collaborative NSF proposal between Prof. Marone and my current advisor Prof. Rubin at Princeton University.</li><br>

  <li>With <a href="https://www.sas.upenn.edu/earth/people/douglas-j-jerolmack">Prof. Douglas J. Jerolmack</a> (University of Pennsylvania), I continue to work on granular physics of creep as related to soil and sediment transport in natural environments.</li><br>

  <li>With <a href="http://scrippsscholars.ucsd.edu/jwillenbring">Prof. Jane Willenbring</a> (Scripps Institution of Oceanography, and the University of California San Diego) and Emma Harrison (PhD student in Jane's group), I am working on the implications and controls of slow granular deformations for the rate of soil transport and mixing, measured through geochemical methods.</li><br>

  <li>With Enrique M. del Castillo '19 (Princeton, now PhD student at Stanford University), I am continuing to work on the grain-scale physics of critical-taper theory and mountain-building processes.</li>
